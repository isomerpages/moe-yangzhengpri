We would like to remind parents, guardians and visitors who are coming into the school to see your child/ward or any teacher or on official business to sign in at the Security Post located at Gate C. Please be reminded that the security sticker issued is to be displayed prominently at all times. Anyone found without the security sticker will be asked to leave the school premises immediately.

Please do not go directly to the classrooms without permission. We would appreciate it if you could proceed to the General office to inform the counter staff the purpose of your visit.

Exit pass will be issued by General Office and parent has to return the exit pass to the security guard for clearance.

  

**Q14. Can parents send item(s) to the school if their child have forgotten to bring it?**

As part of our school’s effort in inculcating the school value of Responsibility in our pupils, we have informed our pupils that they must take charge and be responsible for the things that they need in school. These include stationery, books, assignments, consent forms, etc. In the event that they forget to bring these items, we seek your fullest cooperation and support in this effort by NOT bringing the item(s) to school for them.

The school records the names of pupils who have forgotten their items and those who asked parents/ guardians to bring for them. The school may take reference to this record in the pupils’ conduct grade.

  

**Q15. Change of address/telephone number**

Please inform the General Office promptly if there are any changes in your child’s/ ward’s particulars such as home address and contact numbers. Please update your latest mobile phone number with us so that the school can contact you in times of emergencies.
