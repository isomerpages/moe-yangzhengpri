<h3>MOE Kindergarten – Where Every Space Is a Learning Space</h3>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that a thoughtfully designed environment
plays an important role in supporting children’s learning and development.
Our learning spaces are intentionally created to spark curiosity, encourage
exploration, and support meaningful play — where every space becomes a
place for learning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Our Learning Theme for the Year<br></h2>
<p>This year, our learning experiences are anchored in the works of <strong>Eric Carle</strong>,
a much-loved children’s author and illustrator. His stories, known for
their vibrant illustrations and simple yet meaningful messages, provide
rich opportunities for children to explore language, creativity, and the
world around them.</p>
<p>Each class will explore a selected Eric Carle story as its learning theme,
supporting storytelling, hands-on activities, and purposeful play that
nurture curiosity, imagination, and a love for learning.
<br>During each term’s revision week, children will also have the opportunity
to visit another class to experience a different Eric Carle story. A similar
sharing experience will take place during Children’s Day.</p>
