<p>MK @ Yangzheng commenced operations in January 2024, welcoming its first
cohort of Kindergarten 1 children.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are joyful, curious, active
and competent learners, and we are committed to giving every child a strong
start. We nurture children holistically so that they grow in confidence,
develop strong social skills, and build a firm foundation in literacy and
numeracy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our curriculum is developed by MOE curriculum specialists and delivered
by trained educators with expertise in the early childhood education and
an understanding of the primary school curriculum. Through our flagship
HI-Light Programme and Starlight Literacy Programme, children engage in
meaningful learning experiences that support their overall development
and foster a joy of learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To support working families, we also provide full-day Kindergarten Care
(KCare) for enrolled children.</p>
