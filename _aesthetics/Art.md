The Art education in Yangzheng Primary School provides a foundation for the pupils to understand and make meaning of what they see and communicate their ideas by using and creating visual. The school-based curriculum builds on the Primary Art Syllabus which encompasses a range of media and a curated selection of artworks by local and international artists. They are organised thematically to enable teachers to engage pupils in inquiry and learning of art concepts.

The pupils are given opportunities to experiment various media (e.g., painting, mixed/new media, sculpture) and explore different techniques to enhance their learning experiences. For example, the lower primary curriculum introduces them to 2D art-making processes focusing on dry media, with wet media introduced as washes to complement the dry.
