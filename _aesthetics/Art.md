The Art education in Yangzheng Primary School provides a foundation for the pupils to understand and make meaning of what they see and communicate their ideas by using and creating visual. The school-based curriculum builds on the Primary Art Syllabus which encompasses a range of media and a curated selection of artworks by local and international artists. They are organised thematically to enable teachers to engage pupils in inquiry and learning of art concepts.

The pupils are given opportunities to experiment various media (e.g., painting, mixed/new media, sculpture) and explore different techniques to enhance their learning experiences. For example, the lower primary curriculum introduces them to 2D art-making processes focusing on dry media, with wet media introduced as washes to complement the dry.

From Primary 1, pupils are introduced to art vocabulary such as the elements of art (e.g. colour and shape) to talk about their artistic processes (e.g. inspiration, emotion) in the appropriate terms.

During art lessons, when middle primary pupils are creating their own pieces, they are also constantly engaging in dialogue with the teachers as they think about what they want to portray and how to do it. This dialogue helps them to cultivate Emerging 21st Century Competencies skills such as Adaptive Thinking.

In addition to the conventional drawing and colouring lessons, upper primary pupils also learn to use tablets and apps to explore drawing and coloring digitally. This approach of art making offers intuitive interfaces, with tools like canvas, brushes, colour pickers, gradients and shape creators for the pupils to transform their physical drawings to digital paintings. The students also learn to use the Interactive Thinking tools in the Student Learning Space to safekeep their digital artworks and related feedback in their e-portfolio.
