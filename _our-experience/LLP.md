<h2>Confident and Caring Leaders, Leading Self and Leading Others</h2>
<p>Yangzheng’s Learning for Life Programme centers on Student Leadership
&amp; Life skills. The school implements the Learning for Life Programme
through our 4H Leadership Model.</p>
<p>4H Leadership Model focusing on the 4 domains of 4H Leadership@Yangzheng</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Head (Critical Thinking &amp; Problem Solving)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart (Socio-emotional skills in working with others)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands (Technological soft skills)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health (Physical &amp; Mental)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4H Leadership@ Yangzheng focuses in nurturing confident and caring leaders,
leading self and leading others. Building on the strong fundamentals of
the 4H Leadership model, and Kouzes and Posner Leadership Challenge Model,
the YZPS student leadership programme is committed to developing confident
leaders who can lead self and others. This is achieved through the various
programs, trainings and opportunities provided to all leaders. The 4H Leadership@
Yangzheng believes that every student has the potential to be a student
leader and should be given the opportunity to take the lead in different
leadership roles. We believe that the opportunities and trainings and will
equip our YZnites with the skills and competencies to enable them to carry
out their responsibilities, reflect and grow in their role as leaders.</p>
<p>We groom values-centric leaders who show care and are grounded in strong
school values of passion for learning, responsibility, integrity, self-discipline
and empathy and actively contribute to the community. This is achieved
through the provision of level-wide programmes and Values-in-Action platforms.</p>
<h2>YZPS LLP Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong>&nbsp;All students from P1-P6 will be given the
exposure and engagement and they will be exposed to basic leadership competencies
and lifeskills.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong>&nbsp;Students selected as student leaders will
be given the exposure and engagement needed. In this tier, students who
are identified with leadership potential at Primary 3 to Primary 6 will
be given more opportunities to practise and experience leadership roles
at class and school level. These student leaders will be given platforms
and programmes to participate to improve and sharpen their leadership potential.
The focus is on developing the YZPS 4H Leadership competencies, MICEE competencies,
self–leadership and team leadership in all students leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> 
<br>Student leaders who are identified with greater leadership potential at
Primary 4, 5 and 6 are assigned with larger leadership roles. This group
of student leaders will be further developed, especially in the area of
engaging and influencing their peers, so that they are equipped with the
skill-set to lead their fellow schoolmates to serve the school community
and the community at large. They will also have the opportunity to network
and train with the student leaders from the cluster schools. The focus
is on developing the YZPS 4H Leadership competencies, MICEE competencies,
self–leadership, team leadership and thought-leadership in all student
leaders.</p>
<p><strong>PREFECTS</strong> 
<br>The prefectorial board is an integral part of Yangzheng. Our prefects
role model, inspire and lead the student community. Through a range of
trainings, activities, on-the-job experiences and mentoring by teachers,
our students leaders are developed to become caring and empathetic leaders
who are equipped with 21cc skills and competencies to become confident
and caring leaders who are capable of leading self and others.</p>
