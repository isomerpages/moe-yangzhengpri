Values In Action (VIA) is a learning experience in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhances students’ development as socially responsible citizens through ownership of their contribution to the community.

  

Through the VIA programmes, students will be more aware and concerned about social issues around them and are committed to lead in modelling the values through their actions. Through the experiences, we aim for them to learn how they can contribute positively as a young citizen. As they demonstrate understanding of their learning through reflections and gratitude, they willingly and actively improve the lives of others through their actions.

  

**Everyday VIA – Everyday Cleanliness** <br>
Pupils take the responsibility for the cleanliness of the school environment by keeping the places such as classrooms and canteen clean.  

  

**Children’s Day cum VIA Day** <br>
At Yangzheng, we celebrate Children’s Day with the aim to increase awareness on the rights and education of children as they are the strength of the nation and foundation of society. It is important for them to think bigger than themselves and the theme for Children’s Day is “I want to be a Changemaker!”
