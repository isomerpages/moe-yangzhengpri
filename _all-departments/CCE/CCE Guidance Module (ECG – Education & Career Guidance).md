Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips pupils with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives.

  

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is developmental in nature, and seeks to meet the needs of students at every stage of their education. Through ECG, students develop social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience that will prepare them for the 21st century.

Primary 3 and 4: Explore and Discover
-------------------------------------

At Primary 3 and 4, ECG lessons provide opportunities for pupils to explore the world-of-work  

  

as well as to allow pupils to understand their interests, talents, strengths, skills in relation to the world of work. They learn and discover for themselves the different areas of smart (body smart, nature smart, etc) through card games played in class.

Primary 5 and 6: Dream for Our Future
-------------------------------------

At Primary 5 and 6, ECG lessons allow pupils to further discover and explore opportunities related to various occupations. Opportunities are provided for form teachers and pupils to explore pupils’ aspirations together through a variety of lesson activities. Pupils will also chart their own education pathway to work towards entry to their dream secondary school.  

  

**MySkillsFuture Portal for P5 and 6 pupils** <br>
The MySkillsFuture portal for pupils is a one-stop ECG portal that empowers our Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Pupils may use the information and tools to explore various education and career pathways, and take charge of their future. Pupils are given opportunities to explore their educational and career interests via MySkillsFuture portal during CCE(FTGP) lessons.  

  

**P6 Career Week** <br>
The career talk is conducted for all Primary 6 pupils at the end of the year as part of the post-PSLE activity. The objectives are to allow students to learn about the different types of careers, appreciate that there are many interesting career around us, besides those they are familiar with and know that every of is about doing meaningful work. The main theme of the sharing revolves around looking at what problems different careers help the world solve. The intention is to change students’ mindset of the purpose of work. Instead of thinking about “what they will like to be when they grow up?” to “what problems they will like to help the world solve?”

Prior to Covid-19, the school invited speakers to talk to our students in person.</figcaption>

  

Since 2020, due to the Covid pandemic, the school moved to online versions of the career talks through recorded interviews. Each student is to pen down his/her reflection upon learning from each of the speaker in an in-house customized ECG Booklet.
