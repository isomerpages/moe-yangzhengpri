Physical and Health Education (PHE) plays an important role in the physical growth and development of pupils. Through PHE, pupils acquire the knowledge, skills, right attitudes and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle. It also provides an avenue for pupils to express themselves through movement and physical activity. At Yangzheng Primary School, we envision each child that comes through our PHE programme a healthy and happy child.

  

Pupils will embark on a journey to become competent movers through different learning areas. The learning areas include athletics (P3 to P6), dance, games and sports, gymnastics, outdoor education, physical health and fitness, and swimming. For games and sports, emphasis will be placed on developing pupils’ fundamental motor skills in their quest to become competent movers.

**P6 Sports Extravaganza**

The P6 Sports Extravaganza is an annual post-PSLE activity for the P6 pupils. It aims to promote team building and sports participation at a competitive level, and expose pupils to sports that are less commonly played during curriculum time. Some of the sports introduced during past editions of the programme include Bowling, Golf, Inline Skating and Fencing.

  

**SwimSafer Programme**

Since 2011, our Primary 3 pupils have been taking part in the SwimSafer Programme. SwimSafer is a national water safety programme introduced by the National Water Safety Council (NWSC) in July 2010, with SwimSafer 2.0 launched in 2018. The programme aims to equip pupils with basic swimming skills as well as water safety awareness. The lessons are currently conducted during curriculum time and they are carried out by MOE-accredited vendors.

**Sports Fiesta**

Sports Fiesta is an annual Sports Event held in Yangzheng Primary School. It allows pupils to get together with their peers and compete in games under the house system. The P1 and P2 pupils compete in one of three relays based on the different fundamentals and locomotor skills that they have learnt. The P3 to P6 pupils compete in one of the six games of Basketball, Captain’s Ball, Dodgeball, Skipping, Soccer and Volleyball. In 2021, the Iron Kid Challenge was introduced in place of the Sports Fiesta experience for our P3 to P6 pupils due to the prevailing Safe Management Measures (SMM). Pupils competed in three different activities that demonstrated their proficiency across different skill-related fitness components.
