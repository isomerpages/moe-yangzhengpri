![CCA Identity](/images/CCA%20identity.png)

CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education. Through CCA, pupils discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among pupils from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Through CCA, pupils also develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.

  

While CCA is not compulsory at the primary level, pupils are strongly encouraged to take part in CCA starting from Primary 3 onwards. In order to broaden their experiences and learn a wider range of skills, pupils may choose to take up another CCA if they are able to manage their commitments in school and there are no clashes with their existing CCA. Pupils are also encouraged to stay on in their allocated CCA for at least a year before deciding to move on to another CCA.

P2 CCA Experience
-----------------

To inspire the joy of learning in our pupils, and to allow them to make an informed decision when signing up for a CCA in Primary 3, Primary 2 pupils will be given the opportunity to attend sessions organized by each CCA group to gain a better understanding about the CCA Experience in Yangzheng Primary. We hope that this will help the pupils to make an informed choice when he/she registers for CCA in Primary 3.

  

At Yangzheng Primary School, we offer a selection of CCA programmes that is consistent with the school’s mission and MOE’s policies. Our CCA programmes are grouped into four categories Aesthetics, Clubs, Sports and Uniformed Groups.
