<p>CCA is an integral part of our pupils’ holistic education. Through CCA,
pupils discover their interests and talents while developing values and
competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also
promotes friendships among pupils from diverse backgrounds as they learn,
play and grow together. Through CCA, pupils also develop a sense of identity
and belonging to the school.</p>
<p>While CCA is not compulsory at the primary level, pupils are strongly
encouraged to take part in CCA starting from Primary 3 onwards. In order
to broaden their experiences and learn a wider range of skills, pupils
may choose to take up another CCA if they are able to manage their commitments
in school and there are no clashes with their existing CCA. Pupils are
also encouraged to stay on in their allocated CCA for at least a year before
deciding to move on to another CCA.</p>
<p>At Yangzheng Primary School, we offer a selection of CCA programmes that
is consistent with the school’s mission and MOE’s policies. Our CCA programmes
are grouped into four categories Aesthetics, Clubs, Sports and Uniformed
Groups.</p>

<p><strong>P2 CCA Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>The school introduced this programme to inspire the joy of learning in
our pupils, and to allow them to make an informed decision when signing
up for a CCA in Primary 3, Primary 2 pupils will be given the opportunity
to attend sessions organized by each CCA group to gain a better understanding
about the CCA Experience in Yangzheng Primary. We hope that this will help
the pupils to make an informed choice when he/she registers for CCA in
Primary 3.</p>
<p>All CCA will be scheduled to carry out the experience programme for the
Primary 2 pupils starting from Term 2 to Term 4 of each year</p>
