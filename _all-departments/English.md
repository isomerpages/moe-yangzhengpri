<h3><strong>Characters Come Alive!</strong></h3>
<p>The English department organised a special programme during the third
week of Term 3 to ignite the joy of reading among students. On Monday,
8 July 2024, teachers and students came to school dressed as their favourite
storybook characters, creating a lively atmosphere. In addition to sharing
interesting facts about their characters in class, students participated
in storytelling activities and Bingo games in the library. This event allowed
students to explore a variety of books recommended by their peers, fostering
a love for reading.</p>

<h3><strong>WONDERS</strong></h3>
<p>Play pedagogy is an educational approach that uses play as a fundamental
method for enhancing learning and development in students. We incorporate
Play Pedagogy through our ‘WONDERS’ programme, which encourages teachers
to design activities that blend play with curriculum objectives, making
learning more interactive and enjoyable for students. By integrating play
into the educational process, we aim to foster creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. This approach creates a more engaging and holistic learning
environment, helping students develop essential life skills alongside their
academic knowledge.</p>

<h3><strong>Staff Professional Development and Bonding Day</strong></h3>
<p>Watching musicals can provide educators with creative insights and inspiration
that enhance their teaching practices and engage students in new ways.
On 28 March, the EL department colleagues went on a learning journey to
watch the musical “Matilda” at Marina Bay Sands. This musical is based
on Roald Dahl’s novel, <em>Matilda</em>. It was a great opportunity for
the teachers to learn about the different aspects of drama and adapt the
ideas during the Reader’s Theatre lessons.</p>
