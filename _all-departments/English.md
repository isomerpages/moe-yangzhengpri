<h3><strong>Characters Come Alive!</strong></h3>
<p>The English department organised a special programme during the third
week of Term 3 to ignite the joy of reading among students. On Monday,
8 July 2024, teachers and students came to school dressed as their favourite
storybook characters, creating a lively atmosphere. In addition to sharing
interesting facts about their characters in class, students participated
in storytelling activities and Bingo games in the library. This event allowed
students to explore a variety of books recommended by their peers, fostering
a love for reading.</p>

<h3><strong>WONDERS</strong></h3>
<p>Play pedagogy is an educational approach that uses play as a fundamental
method for enhancing learning and development in students. We incorporate
Play Pedagogy through our ‘WONDERS’ programme, which encourages teachers
to design activities that blend play with curriculum objectives, making
learning more interactive and enjoyable for students. By integrating play
into the educational process, we aim to foster creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. This approach creates a more engaging and holistic learning
environment, helping students develop essential life skills alongside their
academic knowledge.</p>

<h3><strong>Staff Professional Development and Bonding Day</strong></h3>
<p>Watching musicals can provide educators with creative insights and inspiration
that enhance their teaching practices and engage students in new ways.
On 28 March, the EL department colleagues went on a learning journey to
watch the musical “Matilda” at Marina Bay Sands. This musical is based
on Roald Dahl’s novel, <em>Matilda</em>. It was a great opportunity for
the teachers to learn about the different aspects of drama and adapt the
ideas during the Reader’s Theatre lessons.</p>

<h3><strong>Primary 1 and 2 Show and Tell</strong></h3>
<p>Show and Tell fosters communication skills by allowing students to share
their interests and experiences in a supportive environment. It provides
an opportunity for students to practice academic vocabulary, pronunciation,
and expression to help them become confident speakers.</p>

<h3><strong>Primary 4 Theatre Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Experiencing live theatre immerses children in a dynamic environment that
enhances their appreciation for the arts and nurtures their emotional intelligence.
A live theatrical performance engages children in a way that a movie cannot,
exposes them to performing arts, ignites their imagination, and develops
empathy. This year, the Primary 4 pupils had the opportunity to watch an
interactive musical—<em>Errol’s Garden</em>—at the Singapore Theatre Company.
Students learnt about theatre etiquette, the importance of nature, and
how dreams can come true if everyone works together.</p>

<h3><strong>Primary 3 and 4 Reader’s Theatre</strong></h3>
<p>Reader’s Theatre enhances students' reading fluency and comprehension
by encouraging them to engage with texts in a dynamic way. This collaborative
approach also builds confidence in public speaking and fosters teamwork
skills. Reader’s theatre is a style of performing in which the students
collaborate to present dramatic readings of narrative material confidently
without costumes, props, scenery, or special lighting.</p>
