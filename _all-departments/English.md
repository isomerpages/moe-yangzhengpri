<h3><strong>Characters Come Alive!</strong></h3>
<p>The English department organised a special programme during the third
week of Term 3 to ignite the joy of reading among students. On Monday,
8 July 2024, teachers and students came to school dressed as their favourite
storybook characters, creating a lively atmosphere. In addition to sharing
interesting facts about their characters in class, students participated
in storytelling activities and Bingo games in the library. This event allowed
students to explore a variety of books recommended by their peers, fostering
a love for reading.</p>
