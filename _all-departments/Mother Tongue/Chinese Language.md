The Chinese Department hopes to develop pupils’ interest in the language by making learning an enjoyable experience that they will continue to use it in their day-to-day living. As such, with the aim of developing our students to become effective and competent language learners, department programmes are designed to steer pupils progressively towards becoming Confident Speakers, Avid Readers, Proficient Writers and Culture Inheritor.

  

The department focuses on the students’ acquisition and development of these main skills of language learning, namely, Reading & Listening, Speaking & Writing and Viewing & Representing.

<u>Modular Oral Packages (P1-P6)</u> <br>
Unique oral packages for the six levels were developed to progressively teach pupils oracy skills, from reading aloud to conversational skills.

  

<u>Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme</u>
The purpose of Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme is to strengthen bonds among students of different races and at the same time helping pupils acquire the languages that would enable them to operate comfortably in the region. We hope that through this programme, we will enable students to have some grounding of the language so that they could more easily pick up the language in their adult life.

Developing pupils into Avid Readers
-----------------------------------

<u>YZ CL Reading Programme</u> <br>
To arouse pupils’ interest in reading, varied and interesting titles are prepared for students of all levels within the school. These books or articles further complement and add on to what the school library already offers. Through the variety of titles available, students are exposed to a myriad of text-types and writing styles. Students are encouraged to write short synopses and complete interesting post-reading activities.

  

<u>Uninterrupted Silent Reading (P1-P6)</u> <br> 
Silent Reading is a pre-assembly reading programme where students read silently before the commencement of the daily Flag Raising Ceremony. Mother Tongue story books are read on Thursdays and Fridays. Through Silent Reading, majority of students are ensured a daily dose of reading of at least 5-15 minutes.

-----------------------------------------

<u>Publication of 《星海》 – A compilation of articles written by pupils</u> <br>
