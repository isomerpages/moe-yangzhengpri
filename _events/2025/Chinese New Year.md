<p>On 28th January 2025, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of
the Snake with a host of activities which are planned for the students
using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that
values &amp; beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. As part of the
celebrations, the students wore red to school, making the atmosphere more
vibrant and celebratory.</p>

<p>To kick-start the entire celebration, our Principal Mrs Lim-Foo performed
the ‘Dotting the Eyes of the Dragon’ ceremony to ceremonially awaken and
bring the dragon to life. &nbsp;Following that, our students were thrilled
by an amazing Dragon Dance performance by our Yeung Ching Alumni as they
set everyone’s hearts palpitating with excitement. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Following that, Mrs Lim-Foo presented couplet of blessings to each of
our P6 classes, wishing our graduating cohort all the very best for their
PSLE. She then gave out red packets to our Operational Support Staff and
contract cleaners, wishing them good health for the New Year.</p>

<p>Next, the results of the CNY Best Decorated Classroom competition were
revealed.&nbsp; All classes had put in their finest efforts in the competition,
putting up gorgeous festive decorations to liven up the CNY atmosphere
in the school. There were so many well-decorated classrooms that the judges
had a difficult time to pick the winners this year. The following are some
of the stunning decorations by the winning classes:</p>

<p>Our talented students put up a stellar performance and brought festive
joy to the audience. We had the Chinese Dance and Guzheng CCA groups showcasing
their best efforts in this celebration. This year’s concert was also brightened
by two adorable CNY performances put up by our MOE Kindergarten K1 and
K2 students.</p>

<p>In the concert, games continued to be included for the students to learn
about Chinese New Year in an engaging and fun way. It was great joy to
see students of different races, coming together to understand Chinese
culture and traditions.</p>

<p>The concert included jovial Chinese New Year wishes by our school leaders,
staff and students. It ended on a high note with mass singing. At the same
time, our school leaders also gave each staff a pair of mandarin oranges
as part of the Chinese tradition which signifies blessing of prosperity
upon the recipient. It was a vibrant Chinese New Year Celebrations this
year and it was wonderful to see the students’ involvement and excited
faces today.</p>

<p>As part of the celebrations, students were engaged in CNY craftwork activities
in the class. It was really heartening to see students of different races
working together to complete their craftwork activity. The school also
leveraged on an e-card platform (kudoboard) to post the pictures of the
students’ completed craftwork, together with a Chinese New Year Greeting
and reflection of their experience of completing the activity with their
classmates.</p>
