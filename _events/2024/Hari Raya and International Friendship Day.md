Just as we had done in Term 1 with Chinese New Year Celebrations + Total Defence Day, we carried out the meaningful integration of Hari Raya Puasa and International Friendship Day this Term 2.  The integration of celebrations helped our students develop a deeper sense of appreciation for the people and communities around them by understanding traditional and cultural practices.

The activities commenced with an Assembly Programme on 1 April which started with an adorable Fashion Parade by our lower primary Muslim students. This was followed by a skit put up by our talented teachers about how learning about the cultures of different countries allows us to connect with cultures that are different from our own, and that we should continue to nurture the spirit of friendship and partnership among different countries and different people. Finally, the assembly programme concluded with a quiz for the students to learn about Hari Raya Puasa and International Friendship Day.

Following the Assembly Programme, there were craftwork activities (integrating both Hari Raya Puasa + International Friendship Day) for the students in their classrooms during WE-Time. For the P1 – 3 pupils, they wrote notes thanking their friends on square papers provided and formed several large ketupats which were hung as decorations outside their classrooms.

Meanwhile, the P4 – 6 pupils wrote notes celebrating their friendships on Hari Raya lantern cut-outs provided which were hung as decorations inside and outside their classrooms.

Finally, on 12 April, the students consolidated their learning during WE-Time reflecting about how learning and understanding other traditional and cultural practices helps them to build a deeper sense of appreciation of the people and communities around them.

It was a meaningful and engaging Hari Raya Puasa and International Friendship Day for all our students. We thank all our staff, students and parents for their support for the successful conduct of this combined event.
