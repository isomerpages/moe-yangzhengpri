During the celebration of Hari Raya Puasa this year, Yangzheng Primary continued to promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, with the common theme across all festivals -“Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites”

  

On 18 and 20 May 2022, the school celebrated Hari Raya Puasa with activities which are planned for the pupils using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach.

During the Hari Raya Puasa Assembly Programme on 18 May 2022, the pupils learnt about the significance of Hari Raya Puasa and how Hari Raya Puasa is celebrated in Singapore. The Assembly Programme included a quiz segment and ended with a lively Hari Raya Puasa Dance segment for all pupils in their classrooms.

The school also continued to leverage on the kudoboard e-card platform for pupils to submit pictures of their completed craftwork, together with a reflection of how learning about other customs through shared experiences helps build racial harmony among Yangzhengnites.

  

It was a joyful and engaging Hari Raya Puasa Celebrations for all our pupils. We thank all our staff, pupils and parents for their support as we celebrate our diversity and edify our Yangzhengnites to learn about national identity and harmony in a fun and uplifting way.
