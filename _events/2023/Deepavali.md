During the celebration of Deepavali this year, Yangzheng Primary continued to promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, with the common theme across all festivals \- “Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites”

On 10 November 2023, the school celebrated Deepavali with activities which are planned for the pupils using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach.

During the Deepavali Assembly Programme on 10 November 2023, the pupils learnt about the facts and story of Deepavali as well as traditional Deepavali practices. The Assembly Programme included two interactive activities (one on food and one on attire) for the various levels. These interactive activities include Costume Jigsaw (P1 & P2), Matching Names to Costume (P3 & P4), Tying of Veshti (P5) and Tying of a Saree (P6).

The school also continued to leverage on the kudoboard e-card platform for pupils to submit pictures of their completed craftwork, together with a reflection of about either racial harmony or something new they had learnt about Deepavali.

It was a joyful and engaging Deepavali Celebrations for all our pupils. We thank all our staff, pupils and parents for their support as we celebrate our diversity and edify our Yangzhengnites to learn about national identity and harmony in a fun and uplifting way.
