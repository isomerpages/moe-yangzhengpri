During the celebration of Hari Raya Puasa this year, Yangzheng Primary continued to promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, with the common theme across all festivals \- “Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites”

On 21 April 2023, the school celebrated Hari Raya Puasa with activities which are planned for the pupils using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach.

During the Hari Raya Puasa Assembly Programme, the pupils learnt about the significance of Hari Raya Puasa and how Hari Raya Puasa is celebrated in Singapore. The Assembly Programme included two interactive activities (one on food and one on attire) for the various levels. These interactive activities include Costume Jigsaw (P1 & P2), Name the Hari Raya Dishes & Kuih (P3 & P4) and Wearing Samping (P5 & P6).

The school also continued to leverage on the kudoboard e-card platform for pupils to submit pictures of their completed craftwork, together with a reflection of how learning about other customs through shared experiences helps build racial harmony among Yangzhengnites.
