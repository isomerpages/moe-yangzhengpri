**“Celebrating Diversity & Building a Sense of Belonging”**
**Lunar New Year Celebrations and Total Defence Day 2024**

This year, our school had weaved both the Lunar New Year Celebrations and Total Defence Day together to deepen our students’ appreciation of our country and more importantly urged them to be active protectors of our country’s peace and harmony. A host of activities were planned for the students using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that values & beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. The students learnt about possibilities of disruptions and also how to be safe in emergencies which can happen anytime including festive periods.

On 9th February 2024, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of the Dragon with a Lunar New Year Celebrations Concert. The students wore traditional ethnic costumes to school, making the atmosphere more vibrant and celebratory. To kick-start the entire celebration, our students were thrilled by an amazing Dragon Dance performance by our Yeung Ching Alumni as they set everyone’s hearts palpitating with excitement. Following that, our Principal Mrs Lim-Foo presented couplet of blessings to each of our P6 classes, wishing our graduating cohort all the very best for their PSLE.

Our talented students put up a stellar performance and brought festive joy to the audience. We had the Concert Band and Modern Dance CCA groups showcasing their best efforts in this celebration. An addition to this year’s concert was an adorable CNY performance put up by our MOE Kindergarten students. In the concert, games continued to be included for the students to learn about Chinese New Year in an engaging and fun way. It was great joy to see students of different races, coming together to understand Chinese culture and traditions.

The concert ended on a high note with mass singing while our school leaders gave each staff a pair of mandarin oranges as part of the Chinese tradition which signifies blessing of prosperity upon the recipient. In addition to the concert, students were engaged in CNY craftwork activities in the classrooms on 9 February.

Building on the Lunar New Year Celebrations, the school commemorated Total Defence Day in the week of 14 to 16 February 2024 to mark Singapore's fall to the Japanese in 1942. The commemoration of Total Defence Day seeks to remind everyone the sufferings endured by our forefathers during the Japanese Occupation, and Total Defence Day falls on 15 Feb every year. With the partnership of the Singapore Police Force, as well as Total Defence 40 (TD40) activities from 15 February to 16 February, our students had first-hand experience of the role that every Singaporean can play in Singapore’s Defence in ensuring our nation’s survival, growth and prosperity.

It was a vibrant Lunar New Year Celebrations+Total Defence Day this year and it was wonderful to see the students’ involvement and excited faces throughout the event. The school would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff, students and parents for their support for the successful conduct of this combined event.
