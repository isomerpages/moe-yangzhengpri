<p style="text-align:center;">WELCOME TO YANGZHENG PRIMARY SCHOOL,<br>New P1 Yangzhengnites!</p>

Yangzheng Primary School strongly encourages the enthusiastic participation of family members in their child’s educational journey with the school. It was heartwarming to see parents accompanying their children on the first day of school.

On behalf of the Yangzheng family, our Principal, Mrs Lim-Foo Boon Ching, warmly welcomed the new students and their parents to the school. Following that, while our new P1 Yangzhengnites were involved in the school’s Orientation Programme, their parents were given an overview of what their Primary 1 child will experience in school and the close home-school communication channels between the school and the parents. Thereafter, the parents were able to observe their child during recess at the canteen.

During recess, the students were taken care of by their teachers who orientated them on how to buy food at the canteen and how to also practice social responsibility through handwashing and wipe-down routines.

In the classrooms, the P1 students were engaged in orientation activities. Among the Orientation Activities were “Snakes and Ladders” game where the students learnt to foster friendships with their new classmates, and Tangrams Activity where they learnt about problem-solving.

The new Yangzhengnites were brought on a guided school tour around the school in order for them to get to know the school. The students visited the Library, Heritage Gallery, Playground, Pavilion in the Eco-Garden, LEGO Wall by the P6 Student Leaders, Indoor Sports Hall and other places in the school.

During the next two days, all P4 students were tasked to take care of the P1 students during recess. The senior buddies not only took good care of their younger buddies but spent time chatting and sharing about the school’s expectations, school vision and mission, as well as the PRISM values.
