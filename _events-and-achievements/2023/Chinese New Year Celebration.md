To promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, the school has a common theme -“Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites” - for the celebration of the 3 festivals - Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali. As we celebrate our diverse cultures across the 3 festivals, the school plans for common shared experiences for our Yangzhengnites to develop their 21CC skills.

On 20th January 2023, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of the Rabbit with a host of activities which are planned for the students using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that values & beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. As part of the celebrations, the students wore traditional ethnic costumes to school, making the atmosphere more vibrant and celebratory.

To kick-start the entire celebration, our Principal Mrs Lim-Foo and Yangzheng “God of Fortune” presented couplet of blessings to each of our P6 classes, wishing our graduating cohort all the very best for their PSLE.

Next, the results of the CNY Best Decorated Classroom competition were revealed.  All classes had put in their finest efforts in the competition, putting up gorgeous festive decorations to liven up the CNY atmosphere in the school. There were so many well-decorated classrooms that the judges had a difficult time to pick the winners this year. The following are some of the stunning decorations by the winning classes:

The concert included jovial Chinese New Year wishes by our school leaders, staff and students. It ended on a high note with mass singing. At the same time, our school leaders also gave each staff a pair of mandarin oranges as part of the Chinese tradition which signifies blessing of prosperity upon the recipient. It was a vibrant Chinese New Year Celebrations this year and it was wonderful to see the students’ involvement and excited faces today.

After the concert, students were engaged in CNY craftwork activities in the class. It was really heartening to see students of different races working together to complete their craftwork activity. The school also leveraged on an e-card platform (kudoboard) to post the pictures of the students’ completed craftwork, together with a Chinese New Year Greeting and reflection of their experience of completing the activity with their classmates.
