Racial Harmony Day is celebrated on July 21 every year. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind pupils on the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony in Singapore.

  

The theme for this year’s Racial Harmony Day is “Common Spaces, Connected Communities”. We want to remind our students that they can play a part to protect the common space, strengthen trust and friendships among the communities, in order to emerge stronger as a more caring, cohesive and resilient nation. Thus, the school organised class activities for our pupils to have a very meaningful and engaging learning experience to deepen their understanding of racial harmony.

  

All Yangzhengnites were strongly encouraged to come to school in ethnic costumes. During class assembly, teachers went through the commemoration slides with their pupils. The first part of the celebration focused on the purpose of commemorating Racial Harmony Day, while pupils were engaged in different activities for the later part of the commemoration.

  

There were hands-on craft activities from the three main races for the Primary 1 to 3 pupils. The Primary 4 watched a video about our unique Singapore hawker culture and made food miniatures using coloured soft clay. The Primary 5 went on a virtual trail around the three ethnic sites in Singapore and learnt how the races and religions existed harmoniously together in a melting pot called Singapore. The Primary 6 pupils were engaged in a conversation with their form teachers about their perception of common spaces and carried out a reflection using scratch art. They were to scratch out how their common space looked like and share with their classmates.
