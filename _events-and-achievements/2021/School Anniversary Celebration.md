The 2021 school year marks **Yangzheng Primary School’s 116th Anniversary** and we have much to celebrate due to current circumstances. This Anniversary celebration was held virtually on 1 March to connect present day Yangzhengnites with those who founded the school and have helped to shape who we are; as well as to acknowledge those who have influenced the character and values that embody the vibrant, engaging, and safe environment we see today. The pupils also heard from the alumni who return to teach at the school and the pupil representatives’ speaking about continuing the spirit of sharing their love for the school in a video.

  

After the video screening, Primary 1-6 form teachers led their class in an **e-Time Capsule activity** where the pupils of each class selected a comic strips or a class portrait to represent their class. The selected artworks were kept in an ‘e-Time Capsule’, scheduled to be opened one year later. We hope this is a fitting way to end off the year’s celebration as the school continue to strive and provide a good education for her pupils!

  

Enjoy the selected masterpieces from the **e-Time Capsule** as a timeline graphic of the school’s response to overcome challenges and relentless efforts to care for her pupils during the pandemic.
