Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of the Ox with a host of festivities on 11th February. In light of the COVID- 19 situation, this year's celebration took place in the form of a virtual concert.

  

To kick-start the celebrations, students were engaged in pre-concert classroom activities. They learnt about the Chinese custom associated with Chinese New Year and had a hands-on session making Chinese Knots “如意结” in the class. It was great joy to see pupils of different races, coming together to understand Chinese culture and traditions.

After the pre-concert segment, we started the virtual concert with a pre-recorded lion dance performance. Students were thrilled by the amazing footwork of our Yeung Ching Scouts Lion Dance Troupe as they set everyone’s hearts palpitating with excitement.
