To promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, the school has a common theme -“Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites” - for the celebration of the 3 festivals - Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali. As we celebrate our diverse cultures across the 3 festivals, the school plans for common shared experiences for our Yangzhengnites to develop their 21CC skills.

On 31&nbsp;st&nbsp;January 2022, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of the Tiger with a host of activities which are planned for the pupils using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that values &amp; beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. As part of the celebrations, the pupils wore traditional ethnic costumes to school, making the atmosphere more vibrant and celebratory.

To kick-start the celebrations, pupils were engaged in classroom activities where they learnt about the Chinese customs associated with Chinese New Year, and this was followed by CNY craftwork activities in the class. For the Primary 1 to 3 pupils, they were involved in paper-folding whereas the Primary 4 to 6 pupils were involved in paper cutting. It was really heartening to see pupils of different races working together to complete their craftwork activity.

The school also leveraged on an e-card platform (kudoboard) to post the pictures of the pupils’ completed craftwork, together with a Chinese New Year Greeting and reflection of their experience of completing the activity with their classmates. The class kudoboard was also shared with the parents of each respective class to keep them updated of the CNY activities their child is doing in school and to provide them a platform to be involved in the school’s CNY celebrations.

During the morning of 31 January 2022, our Principal Mrs Lim-Foo visited the P6 classes with our Yangzheng “God of Wealth”. Mrs Lim-Foo presented her couplet of good luck to each of our P6 classes, wishing our graduating cohort all the very best for their PSLE.

At the same time, our school leaders also gave each staff a pair of mandarin oranges as part of the Chinese tradition which signifies blessing of prosperity upon the recipient.

Next, the results of the CNY Best Decorated Classroom competition were revealed. All classes had put in their finest efforts in the competition, putting up gorgeous festive decorations to liven up the CNY atmosphere in the school. There were so many well-decorated classrooms that the judges had a difficult time to pick the winners this year. The following are some of the stunning decorations by the winning classes:
