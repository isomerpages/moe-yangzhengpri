During the celebration of Deepavali this year, Yangzheng Primary continued to promote a deeper understanding of the different cultures, with the common theme across all festivals -“Celebrating Diversity, Edifying Yangzhengnites”

On 9 and 11 November 2022, the school celebrated Deepavali with activities which are planned for the pupils using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach.

During the Deepavali Assembly Programme on 9 November 2022, the pupils learnt about the facts and story of Deepavali as well as traditional Deepavali practices. The Assembly Programme included a quiz segment and ended with a lively Deepavali Dance item by the P5 Tamil girls.

The craftwork activities included Colouring a Diya Lamp (Primary 1), Making a Rangoli on paper plate (Primary 2), Making a paper Diya Lamp (Primary 3), Colouring of Rangoli (Primary 4), Rangoli Designing (Primary 5) and Henna Designing (Primary 6).
