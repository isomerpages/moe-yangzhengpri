Yanzheng Primary School celebrated its 117th Anniversary on 8 March 2022. The theme for this year’s celebration is “Our History, Our Story”. A series of activities were carried out to celebrate Yangzheng’s heritage and aspirations.

  

This year, a gift pack was thoughtfully prepared for every pupil with the designs on the items done by Yangzhengnites themselves. The lower, middle and upper primary students received unique items put together for their levels. The Primary 1 and 2 pupils came up with the designs for the stickers which were based on the topic “2072 YZnite”. The Primary 3 and 4 pupils contributed to the compilation of a colouring booklet featuring their favourite places in the school. Last but not least, the Primary 5 and 6 pupils received a Rubik’s cube with various school anniversary logos.

  

The celebrations started with an opening address by our Principal, Mrs Lim-Foo, highlighting the school’s milestones and heritage. The assembly programme continued with interviews with alumni from Yeung Ching School and Yangzheng Primary School. Yangzhengnites were also entertained by the talent showcases by Yangzhengnites and a performance by our very own Concert Band. Ex-Yangzhengnites also sent in their well wishes to congratulate the school on its anniversary. The celebrations culminated with the pupils being treated to a virtual tour of our Heritage Gallery to learn about the key events of Yangzheng’s heritage.

  

Through all the activities, Yangzhengnites were able to gain more insights on how Yangzheng Primary School has come to be the well-established institution it is today and inspire them to work together to build and strengthen the identity of the school for many more years to come.
