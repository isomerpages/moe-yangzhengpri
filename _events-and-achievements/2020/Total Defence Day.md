This year, Yangzheng Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) on 10 February 2020. TDD marks Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942 and the commemoration of TDD serves to remind our pupils about the importance of Total Defence as Singapore deals with the threats and challenges of today.

  

The theme for this year’s commemoration is "Together We Keep Singapore Strong." It is especially meaningful this year amid the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A series of classroom commemorative programme and recess activities were conducted during the period of commemoration from 10 to 12 February 2020.

  

During the classroom commemorative programme on 10 February, our pupils gained a better understanding about the six different pillars of Total Defence and how Singaporeans from various walks of life play their part in the fight against COVID-19. Our pupils also came together and contributed towards the Psychological Defence and Civil Defence of Singapore by participating in the nation-wide wipe-down routine.

  

On the same day, the P3 to P6 pupils also had the opportunity to experience what our forefathers went through during the Japanese Occupation by taking part in the food rationing exercise conducted during their recesses. Pupils were each issued with a food rationing coupon which could then be used to exchange for a serving of sweet potato.

  

Over the next two days, pupils’ awareness on civil defence and digital defence were further strengthened through the activities conducted at the concourse. They gained some knowledge about basic first aid at the First Aid awareness booth, and also picked up some cyberwellness tips from our teachers and NE ambassadors from the Digital Defence booth set up by our Cyberwellness team.

  

In line with nation-wide efforts to enhance social responsibility in response to COVID-19, the Wipe Down Routine was introduced on 14th February. Our pupils watched a video on how they can clean up their own space during recess to keep the school canteen clean. During recess on that day and for the subsequent days, pupils have been cleaning up their own space so that our school canteen tables are clean for other pupils to use throughout the different recesses. We hope that such activities will help to instill in our Yangzhengnites the importance of social responsibility and how their simple acts can make a difference.

  

To consolidate pupils’ TDD learning experience, the pupils completed a reflection after the programme to deepen their understanding of their role in keeping Singapore strong and safe.
