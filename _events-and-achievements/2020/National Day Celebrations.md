On 7 August 2020, our school kickstarted Singapore’s 55th birthday celebration with a virtual observance ceremony in the morning. In view of the COVID-19 situation, our school commemorated National Day in a special way this year, both in the lead up to and on the actual day itself. This year’s contingent comprised of teachers representing the different uniformed groups and organisations. Conducted through the Zoom video-conferencing platform, all pupils and staff joined in as one, virtually, to recollect the significance of our National Symbols and took part in the flag-raising and pledge-taking ceremonies in class synchronously.

  

The school came together again in the afternoon for the actual celebration. Our principal delivered the National Day message, emphasizing the importance of how we can build a stronger Singapore despite of the challenges we face for the year. It was followed by a recollection video on the challenges and opportunities that has confronted us in the past, and how we can play a part for our future. Past years’ National Day themes and logos were also revisited, before shedding light on the significance of this year’s theme, “Together a Stronger Singapore.”

  

Though pupils were physically separated due to Safe Management Measures (SMM), there were many segments during the celebrations that brought the school together as one. An interactive quiz was carried out to provide pupils with interesting facts about our nation, followed by a well-wishes activity where all classes posted their wishes and aspirations for Singapore on Padlet.

  

In the lead up to the celebrations, our Primary 5 pupils and teachers have put together a video montage sharing their well wishes for Singapore. Pupils also participated in the Mural Design competition and selected entries were exhibited at the school concourse. The well wishes video was played during the celebration and winners of the competition were announced.

  

The celebrations ended with a songs session where pupils sang along to past and present NDP songs, including this year’s theme song, “Everything I Am”. In the midst of this global pandemic, this year’s celebration reminded our pupils, the leaders of tomorrow, to appreciate our nation and to encourage them to contribute in their own ways to bring our Lion City forward in the years ahead.
