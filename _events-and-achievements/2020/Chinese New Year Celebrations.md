Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of the Rat with a host of festivities on 24th January. Students gathered in the school hall for the CNY concert as they were treated with an array of visual treats. To kick-start the entire celebration, we revealed the results of the Best Decorated Classroom competition.

  

All classes participated in the Best Decorated Classroom competition. Both teachers and pupils worked together and put in their finest efforts to put up the festive decorations to brighten up the classrooms. Differing from past years whereby only one class was chosen from each level, prizes were awarded to the two best decorated classes this year. These were some of the winning classes:

The highlight of the concert was the traditional lion dance performance. Students were thrilled by the amazing footwork of our Yeung Ching Scouts Lion Dance Troupe as they set everyone’s hearts palpitating with excitement.

Our talented pupils put up a stellar performance and brought festive joy to the audience. We had the Chinese Dance, Wushu and Guzheng CCA groups showcasing their best efforts in this celebration. An addition to this year’s performance were a group of students who were selected from the enrichment classes to perform the Cross Talk, Speech and Drama, and Chinese Opera for us.

Games were introduced for the students to learn more about Chinese New Year in an engaging and fun way. It is great joy to see pupils of different races, coming together to understand Chinese culture and traditions.

The Cantonese pronunciation of giving mandarin oranges is "song gam", which sounds like "giving gold". Hence giving mandarin oranges signifies blessing of prosperity upon the recipient. Here’s our school leaders giving the staff a pair of mandarin oranges as part of the celebrations.

The entire celebration ended on a high note with mass singing. Our students had learnt to sing the theme song for this year’s celebration during their music lessons prior to the concert.
