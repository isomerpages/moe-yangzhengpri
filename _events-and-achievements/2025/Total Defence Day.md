<p>Every year Total Defence Day falls on 15 February. This year, the school
commemorated Total Defence Day from 14 to 21 February 2025 to mark Singapore's
fall to the Japanese in 1942. The commemoration of Total&nbsp;Defence&nbsp;Day
seeks to remind everyone the sufferings endured by our forefathers during
the Japanese Occupation as well as to reiterate the role every Singaporean
can play in Singapore’s Defence in ensuring our nation’s survival, growth
and prosperity.</p>

<p>A Total Defence Day assembly programme was put up by our teachers and
NE Ambassadors on 17 February. This was followed by the school’s participation
in Exercise SG Ready 2025 whereby our students experienced a power disruption
simulation.</p>
