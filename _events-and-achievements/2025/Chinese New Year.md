<p>On 28th January 2025, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of
the Snake with a host of activities which are planned for the students
using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that
values &amp; beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. As part of the
celebrations, the students wore red to school, making the atmosphere more
vibrant and celebratory.</p>

<p>To kick-start the entire celebration, our Principal Mrs Lim-Foo performed
the ‘Dotting the Eyes of the Dragon’ ceremony to ceremonially awaken and
bring the dragon to life. &nbsp;Following that, our students were thrilled
by an amazing Dragon Dance performance by our Yeung Ching Alumni as they
set everyone’s hearts palpitating with excitement. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Following that, Mrs Lim-Foo presented couplet of blessings to each of
our P6 classes, wishing our graduating cohort all the very best for their
PSLE. She then gave out red packets to our Operational Support Staff and
contract cleaners, wishing them good health for the New Year.</p>
