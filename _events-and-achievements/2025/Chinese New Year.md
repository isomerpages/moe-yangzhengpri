<p>On 28th January 2025, Yangzheng Primary School ushered in the Year of
the Snake with a host of activities which are planned for the students
using the “Head, Hand and Heart (3H)” approach because we believe that
values &amp; beliefs cannot just remain as head knowledge. As part of the
celebrations, the students wore red to school, making the atmosphere more
vibrant and celebratory.</p>
