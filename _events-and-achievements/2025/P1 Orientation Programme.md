<p style="text-align:center;">WELCOME TO YANGZHENG PRIMARY SCHOOL,<br>New P1 Yangzhengnites!</p>

Yangzheng Primary School strongly encourages the enthusiastic participation of family members in their child’s educational journey with the school. It was heartwarming to see parents accompanying their children on the first day of school.

On behalf of the Yangzheng family, our Principal, Mrs Lim-Foo Boon Ching, warmly welcomed the new students and their parents to the school. The new P1 Yangzhengnites were excited meeting their classmates and taking the pledge as a cohort. Their parents were similarly excited, albeit a little anxious, embarking on the primary school journey with their child. Following that, while our new P1 Yangzhengnites were involved in the school’s Orientation Programme, their parents attended the Welcome Programme for parents which included the P1 Parents Briefing, P1 Meet and Greet Sessions, recess observation as well as a Parenting Talk. The Parents Briefing gave the parents an overview of what their Primary 1 child will experience in school and the close home-school communication channels between the school and the parents.
