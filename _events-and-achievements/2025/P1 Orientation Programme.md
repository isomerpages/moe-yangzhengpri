<p style="text-align:center;">WELCOME TO YANGZHENG PRIMARY SCHOOL,<br>New P1 Yangzhengnites!</p>

Yangzheng Primary School strongly encourages the enthusiastic participation of family members in their child’s educational journey with the school. It was heartwarming to see parents accompanying their children on the first day of school.

On behalf of the Yangzheng family, our Principal, Mrs Lim-Foo Boon Ching, warmly welcomed the new students and their parents to the school. The new P1 Yangzhengnites were excited meeting their classmates and taking the pledge as a cohort. Their parents were similarly excited, albeit a little anxious, embarking on the primary school journey with their child. Following that, while our new P1 Yangzhengnites were involved in the school’s Orientation Programme, their parents attended the Welcome Programme for parents which included the P1 Parents Briefing, P1 Meet and Greet Sessions, recess observation as well as a Parenting Talk. The Parents Briefing gave the parents an overview of what their Primary 1 child will experience in school and the close home-school communication channels between the school and the parents.

Following the P1 Parents Briefing, the parents met with their children’s form teachers during the P1 Meet-and-Greet Sessions.

The parents also observed their children during recess at the canteen.The P1 students were taken care of by their teachers and prefects who orientated them on how to buy food at the canteen and practice social responsibility through handwashing and wipe-down routines.

The parents then attended a Parenting Talk entitled “From Preschool to BIG School Starting P1”, conducted by Methodist Welfare Services (Triple P vendor appointed by MSF), which enabled them to gain more insights of how they can support their child’s transition to Primary 1.

In the classrooms, the P1 students were engaged in orientation activities. Among the Orientation Activities were “Snakes and Ladders” game where the students learnt to foster friendships with their new classmates, and Tangrams Activity where they learnt about problem-solving.

The new Yangzhengnites were also brought on a guided school tour around the school in order for them to get to know the school. The students visited the Library, Heritage Gallery, Playground, Pavilion in the Eco-Garden, LEGO Wall by the P6 Student Leaders, Indoor Sports Hall and other places in the school.

During the next two days, P4 students were tasked to take care of the P1 students during recess. The senior buddies not only took good care of their younger buddies but spent time chatting and sharing about the school’s expectations, school vision and mission, as well as the PRISM values.

The P1 students expressed their gratitude to their P4 buddies by making and presenting them with a Thank you Card during the Buddy Appreciation Activity (as part of the school’s WE-Time).
