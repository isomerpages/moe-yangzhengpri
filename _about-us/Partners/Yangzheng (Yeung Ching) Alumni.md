<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Yangzheng (Yeung Ching) Alumni Association (21 and above)</strong></p>

Yeung Ching Alumni was set up in 1918. On 7 March 1952, it was officially registered as an Alumni Association and 7 March was set as the alumni association’s anniversary. The two goals the alumni committee has set are to:

  

1.  Maintain contact and build relationships with the alumni members of Yeung Ching and organise activities for them to upkeep the school spirit and bond among the members
2.  Provide opportunities for the members of the alumni to contribute to the school

  

In mid-1960s, due to the lack of alumni activities for various reasons, the alumni association registration was not renewed. However, in April 2003, Professor Phua Kok Khoo and Mr Lo Hock Ling set out to rejuvenate the alumni and their effort was supported by the alumni members.

  

In June 2003, their application was renewed and the alumni association now include the alumni of Yangzheng Primary School. With that, the alumni association is now known as Yangzheng (Yeung Ching) Alumni Association.
