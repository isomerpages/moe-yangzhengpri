Yeung Ching Scout Open Group was established in 1954 and is one of the oldest Open Scout Group in Singapore. It aims to provide its Scouts with the following opportunities:

  

1\. Learn useful skills and build their leadership qualitiesÂ·

  

*   They will learn scouting skills such as Knotting and First Aid which they can apply in their daily lives.
*   They will learn to organise activities and camps with the guidance from their Scout Leaders

  

2\. Giving back to the society through volunteering work with various organisations

  

3\. Exposure to various outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, sports climbing, kayaking, high elements and camping

  

Since its establishment, Yeung Ching Scout Open Group has been recruiting boys and girls who graduated from Yangzheng Primary School. Through this recruitment, ex-Yangzhengnites are able to keep in touch with the school and render their help to their alma mater during school events.

  

The Scouts will attend weekly CCA on Sundays where lessons on knots, navigation, First Aid and pioneering will be conducted by their Scout Leaders. Every two months, an outing will also be organised for the Scouts to experience outdoor activities, volunteering and camps.

  

Other than activities organised by the Scout Group, the Scouts are also given opportunities to attend events and courses organised by Scout HQ to interact with Scouts from other schools. There will also be chances for them to go for Cultural Exchange Programme with other Scouts organisation around the world.
