The Letter Y for Yangzheng represents the foundation and support the school will give to her pupils.

  

Yangzheng Primary School upholds the belief in the never ending quest for knowledge and this is depicted by the book which rests so securely on the letter Y.

  

The colours blue and gold represent vitality and the finest effort respectively.

  

The three sides of the triangle stand for Acceptance, Love and Perseverance.

Our School Song

We will achieve for love, love for our nation

We will achieve for love, love for our school
