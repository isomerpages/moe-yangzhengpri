Being a Brownie opens up a world of opportunities that will last a lifetime. It provides a safe, girl-only space to explore the activities, issues and possibilities that are available to girls today.

  

The range of activities is enormous and there is something to appeal to everyone, from outdoor challenges to learning new skills, international travel to getting involved in community action projects. One thing is certain, you will make a lot of friends and have a lot of fun.

  

But there is more to guiding than having a good time. Guiding is a game with a purpose. It provides opportunities for girls and young women to:

  

*   Be challenged by new experiences and achieve a sense of pride in accomplishment.
*   Think for themselves and make decisions.
*   Undertake teamwork and acquire leadership skills.
*   Acquire self-awareness, self-respect and self-confidence.
*   Develop personal values which give their lives meaning and direction.
*   Do their best according to their abilities.
*   Seek spiritual development - regardless of faith they belong to.
*   Contribute to society.
*   Live by a simple code â€“ the Brownie Law.
