**Objective / Goal**  <br>
We aim to develop our members' **character, values, leadership** and **teamwork** through authentic and engaging **music making activities**. We provide the platform for students to pursue their interest in music through playing an instrument and performing as an ensemble.  
  
**Life Skills / Values**  <br>
By encouraging high standards of performance with good musicianship, we endeavour to inculcate discipline, grit and perseverance which forms the foundation for further pursuits of music, either casually or formally.

  

In addition to developing the psychomotor, mental and moral strengths in our members, we believe that music will also uplift our members emotionally and socially, as they come together to produce harmonious sounds which can invigorate, or even inspire, one another.

  

Members will not only be cognisant to sounds produced by different instruments, with different playing techniques and different genres of music, but also be given opportunities to learn administrative and organisational skills through different roles pertaining to the upkeep of our instruments, premises, scores and uniform.

With the completion of the Indoor Sports Hall building, we moved to our brand new premises in January 2021, where we now have our own Band Room and practice spaces. Here are some of the instruments that our pupils play.

Below are our current Junior members with some of the Seniors. The Juniors have been treated to weekly performances by the Seniors as they learn more about the Band, fellow members, as well as the different instruments.

Although our Band was formed in 2018, its humble origin can be traced all the way back to 1914, as the Yeung Ching School Brass Band was then known. We are proud of this heritage and hope that our members will uphold the spirit and legacy of the older generation.

Within 1 year of its formation, the Band put up its first performance for our school’s bicentennial celebration in March 2019. They played the energetic piece ‘Rockology’ in the school hall. It was the first time many of our members performed on stage. They have practised very hard and were happy to be able to perform for the school.

In November 2019, the Band put up its second performance at our annual prize giving ceremony. It was another good exposure for our members to build their confidence and hone their showmanship in preparation for the biennial Singapore Youth Festival presentation the following year.

The Band’s participation in the SYF for the first time gave our members the opportunity to perform beyond our school compound. They went to the Singapore Conference Hall for their rehearsal in April 2020. The rehearsal was indeed an eye opener for our members, who were thrilled to visit and experience performing in a real concert venue. The acoustic and layout of the venue was awesome!
