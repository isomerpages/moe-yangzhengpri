Our Modern Dance club introduces the various genres of dance, concentrating on the contemporary dance of hip-hop. It sets the foundation of physical conditioning and builds up the dancers’ strength allowing them to be more aware of their body parts and muscles.

  

The objectives are to develop pupils in:

*   Specific dance and performance skills, which includes management of performances, physical co-ordination, spatial awareness, musicality, timing and expression. The attainment of such skills requires self-discipline, an essential success formula transferable to other aspects of their schooling experience.
*   Appreciating dance as an art form with heightened exposure and more opportunities.
*   The ability to work in synergy with others to dance a perfect routine.
*   Leadership skills within respective groups as students take up positions to lead, manage and motivate one another.
