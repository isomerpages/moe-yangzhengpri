Soccer is one of the more popular sports in the world and we are proud to have it as one of the CCAs in Yangzheng Primary School.

  

Our objectives are to let pupils have fun playing soccer, understand the fundamentals of the game, learn about teamwork and fair play, increase their self-esteem as well as improve their physical fitness.

  

Soccer helps our pupils to develop valuable life skills or values such as

  

*   Decision making (handling many different situations during practice and competition)
*   Social problem solving (realise that they have to depend on their teammates to make anything happen)
*   Responsibility (learn what happens when they don’t play in their usual position)
*   Perseverance (learn that success is no accident and they will have to persevere to be successful)
*   Sportsmanship (understand it is impossible to win every game, they will show empathy to the teams which have lost in competition and congratulate the teams which have won)

  

“You can overcome anything, if, and only if, you love something enough.”

\- Lionel Messi (Barcelona Soccer Club player)
