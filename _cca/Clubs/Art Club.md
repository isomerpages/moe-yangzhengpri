On 24th May 2019, Art Club members visited Zhonghua Secondary School to attend 'Annual Art Graduate Showcase Expose 90 Exhibition 2019'. They were divided into a few groups with a leader assigned to each group.  

  

The leaders led their groups around the exhibition site and took photos of artworks which interested them using iPads. Thereafter, they sat down at different corners to discuss and create a Popplet mindmap regarding their selected artworks.

The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition is an annual national school event organised by the Ministry of Education to provide opportunities for our students to display their artistic talents and to promote art appreciation in our schools. It celebrates the artist in every student and signifies access to art for every student in the art curriculum in schools.

  

The 2019 exhibition theme “Artist and Citizenship” highlights the artist’s role in effecting change in society. The exhibition gives voice to our young artists in schools, inviting them to explore and conduct research on local histories, cultures and traditions of people, places and perspectives. The pupils in turn make connections to contemporary lives today, and activate their own voices.

  

Our Art Club CCA pupils participated in this year's SYF Art Exhibition. The Primary three and four pupils (Category B) designed and created artworks resembling our Singapore landmarks like Changi Airport, Marina Bay Sands, etc. The pupils felt excited and honoured in being able to create these beautiful artworks for the SYF Art Exhibition 2019 and their hard work paid off. They received the Certificate of Recognition for their efforts in producing these artworks.
